[![Jetpack Compose](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jetpack%20Compose-2025.09.01-brightgreen.svg)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

A modern Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It features local data storage using Room and image handling with PhotoPicker and Coil.

## ‚ú®Features

*   **100% Kotlin:** Including asynchronous operations with Coroutines and Flows.
*   **Modern UI Toolkit:** Built entirely with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for a declarative and reactive UI.
*   **Navigation:** Handled by [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation).
*   **Local Data Persistence:** Utilizes [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for structured local data storage.
*   **Image Handling:**
    *   Image selection via [PhotoPicker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker).
    *   Efficient image loading and caching with [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/).
*   **MVVM Architecture:** Follows a Model-View-ViewModel pattern for a clear separation of concerns and testability.
*   **Adaptive UI:** Implements a list-detail view for different screen sizes using [Material 3 Adaptive components](https://m3.material.io/libraries/adaptive/overview), specifically `NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold`.
*   **Testing:** Includes some examples for Unit and (optional) UI tests. (more to come)
*   **Clean Code Principles:** Focus on readability and maintainability.

## üì±Adaptive UI

List Randomizer utilizes Material 3 Adaptive components to create user interfaces that respond to different screen sizes and orientations, focusing on a common list-detail pattern.

*   **`NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold`:** The core of the adaptive layout is the `NavigableListDetailPaneScaffold`. This component from the Material 3 Adaptive library automatically adjusts the layout based on available screen width.
    *   On **smaller screens** (like most phones in portrait mode), it typically displays a single pane (e.g., the list of items). Selecting an item navigates to its detail view, replacing the list.
    *   On **larger screens** (like tablets, foldables, or phones in landscape mode), it can display two panes side-by-side: the list pane and the detail pane. Selecting an item in the list updates the content of the detail pane.
*   **State-Driven Navigation:** The content of the detail pane is controlled by a custom `DetailPaneState` (which includes `ViewItem`, `EditItem`, and `Hidden` states), managed by the `rememberListDetailPaneScaffoldNavigator`. This allows for clear and testable navigation logic within the detail view.
*   **Compose-Powered:** Screen configurations and pane management are handled declaratively in Jetpack Compose, allowing ViewModels to remain largely unaware of specific display sizes.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern:

*   **View (Composables):** Observes `StateFlow` from the `ViewModel` and renders the UI. Sends user events to the `ViewModel`.
*   **ViewModel:** Holds UI-related state (exposed via `StateFlow`) and handles UI logic. Interacts with Repositories to fetch and save data. `ViewModel`s are lifecycle-aware and generally do not need to be aware of the specific screen configuration.
*   **Model (Repositories & Data Sources):** Abstract the data sources (Room database, file system for images). Repositories provide a clean API for `ViewModel`s to access data.
